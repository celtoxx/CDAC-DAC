```

In the diagram:

- (PK) denotes the primary key of the entity.

- (FK) denotes the foreign key referencing the primary key of another entity.

The relationships between the entities are as follows:

- Each "JobVacancy" can have multiple "Applications" (one-to-many relationship).

- Each "Application" can have multiple "Interviews" (one-to-many relationship).

**5. Pictorial Representation**

Here's a pictorial representation connecting the tables based on the relationships:

```

    +-----------------+        +-----------------+        +-----------------+

    | JobTitle        |        | VacancyID (FK)  |        | ApplicationID   |

    | Description     |        | ApplicantName   |        | InterviewDate   |

    | Qualifications  | 1    N | ContactInfo     | 1    N | InterviewTime   |

    | Status          | ------ | WorkExperience  | ------ | Interviewer     |

    +-----------------+        | Education       |        | Notes           |

                              | Status          |

                              +-----------------+

```

The diagram shows the relationships between the "JobVacancy," "Application," and "Interview" entities. Each relationship is labeled with the cardinality (1 to N) and the corresponding foreign key (FK). This pictorial representation provides a visual overview of how the tables are connected in the Employee Recruitment System.

Please note that this is a simplified representation, and additional tables or relationships may be required based on the specific requirements of the system.

==============================================================

Software Requirements Specification (SRS) for an online ticket booking system and provide entity diagrams to illustrate the system's entities and their relationships. Let's start with the SRS.

**Software Requirements Specification (SRS) for Online Ticket Booking System**

1. **Introduction**

   1. Purpose: The purpose of the online ticket booking system is to provide a convenient and efficient platform for users to book tickets for various events or services.

   2. Scope: The system will allow users to browse available events, select seats, make payments, and receive e-tickets. It will also provide an administrative interface for managing events, venues, and user bookings.

   3. Definitions, Acronyms, and Abbreviations: None

2. **System Overview**

   1. System Architecture: The system will be a web-based application built using a three-tier architecture (presentation layer, application layer, and data layer).

   2. System Interfaces: The system will have interfaces for users, administrators, and external payment gateways.

   3. User Characteristics: The system will cater to two types of users: regular users who book tickets and administrators who manage the system.

   4. Constraints: The system should be responsive, secure, and scalable to handle a large number of concurrent users.

3. **Functional Requirements**

   1. User Registration and Login

      - Users should be able to register an account with the system by providing their details.

      - Users should be able to log in to their accounts using their credentials.

   2. Event Management

      - Administrators should be able to add, update, and delete events.

      - Events should have attributes such as title, description, date, time, venue, and available seats.

   3. Ticket Booking

      - Users should be able to browse available events and view event details.

      - Users should be able to select seats and specify the quantity of tickets.

      - Users should be able to add tickets to their shopping cart.

      - Users should be able to proceed to checkout and make payments.

   4. Payment Processing

      - The system should integrate with external payment gateways to process payments securely.

      - Payment options should include credit/debit card, net banking, and mobile wallets.

   5. Ticket Generation

      - Once payment is successful, the system should generate e-tickets containing event details and a unique booking reference.

      - E-tickets should be emailed to the user and stored in their account for future reference.

   6. Booking Management

      - Administrators should be able to view and manage user bookings.

      - Administrators should be able to cancel or refund tickets if required.

   7. Reporting and Analytics

      - The system should provide reports and analytics on ticket sales, revenue, and popular events.

4. **Non-Functional Requirements**

   1. Usability: The system should have an intuitive user interface that is easy to navigate and understand.

   2. Performance: The system should be responsive and handle concurrent user requests efficiently.

   3. Security: The system should implement secure authentication, protect user data, and use encryption for sensitive information.

   4. Reliability: The system should be available 24/7 with minimal downtime for maintenance.

   5. Scalability: The system should be scalable to handle a growing number of users and events.

   6. Compatibility: The system should be compatible with major web browsers and devices.

   7. Maintainability: The system should be easy to maintain and support future enhancements.

5. **System Models**

   - Use Case Diagram: (Provide a use case diagram illustrating the interactions between users and the system

)

   - Class Diagram: (Provide a class diagram representing the classes/entities and their relationships)

   - Sequence Diagram: (Provide a sequence diagram depicting the flow of interactions for a typical ticket booking process)

Now, let's move on to creating the entity diagrams to illustrate the system's entities and their relationships.

**Entity Diagrams**

1. **Event**

   - Attributes: eventID, title, description, date, time, venueID, availableSeats

   - Relationships: One-to-many with Booking

2. **Venue**

   - Attributes: venueID, name, address

   - Relationships: One-to-many with Event

3. **User**

   - Attributes: userID, name, email, password

   - Relationships: One-to-many with Booking

4. **Booking**

   - Attributes: bookingID, userID, eventID, numTickets, bookingDate

   - Relationships: Many-to-one with User and Event

5. **Payment**

   - Attributes: paymentID, bookingID, amount, paymentDate

   - Relationships: One-to-one with Booking

Note: The entity diagrams provide a visual representation of the entities and their relationships. Please note that the diagrams are simplified for illustration purposes, and additional attributes or relationships may be required depending on your specific system requirements.

Unfortunately, as a text-based AI, I'm unable to provide you with a pictorial representation of connected tables. However, you can use the provided entity diagrams as a reference to create your own database schema, connecting the tables based on the relationships described.

I hope this helps you create a comprehensive SRS and entity diagrams for your online ticket booking system! Let me know if you have any further questions.

```

In the diagram:

- (PK) denotes the primary key of the entity.

- (FK) denotes the foreign key referencing the primary key of another entity.

The relationships between the entities are as follows:

- Each "JobVacancy" can have multiple "Applications" (one-to-many relationship).

- Each "Application" can have multiple "Interviews" (one-to-many relationship).

**5. Pictorial Representation**

Here's a pictorial representation connecting the tables based on the relationships:

    | VacancyID (PK)  |        | ApplicationID   |        | InterviewID (PK)|

    | JobTitle        |        | VacancyID (FK)  |        | ApplicationID   |

    | Description     |        | ApplicantName   |        | InterviewDate   |

    | Qualifications  | 1    N | ContactInfo     | 1    N | InterviewTime   |

    | Status          | ------ | WorkExperience  | ------ | Interviewer     |

    +-----------------+        | Education       |        | Notes           |

                              | Resume/CV       |        +-----------------+

                              | Status          |

                              +-----------------+
